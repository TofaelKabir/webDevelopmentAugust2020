package use_of_nested_class;

/*
When a class is defined inside another class, the inside class is called the nested class (static or non static).
Java allows multiple inner classes inside a outer class.
Like any other members of a class, we can declare nested class as static.
Class which is declared as 'static' inside another class is called static nested class.
Class which is declared as 'non static' inside another class is called inner class or non-static nested class.
Unlike a class, an inner class can be private and once you declare an inner class private,
it cannot be accessed from an object outside the class.
A static class created within an outer class. Static member classes (or static nested class)
are not technically an inner class. They are like a static member of outer class.
